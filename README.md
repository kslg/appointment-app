# About

[Fairchild School Appointment App](http link) is for a fictitious school called Fairchild School, and allows Parents, Guardians, Carers to book a consultation with their childâ€™s Teacher. The App is responsive so Parent can book and Teachers can manage appointments on mobile and tablet devices.

The app is developed by [Krishan Gharu](https://github.com/kslg).

Repository: [GitHub Repo](http link)

# User Experience Design

I used the 5 Planes of UX to provide a conceptual framework.


# Strategy Plane:

## Target Audience:

- Target Audience: 
`Users` Parents, Guardians and Carers.
`Admin` Teachers.
`Super Admim` School IT Department / School Office Admins.

## Mission Objectives:

- To develop an `mvp (minimum viable product)` that allows `Users` to book appointments with `Admin` Teachers for parents evening and other consultations.
- The app must be simple, easy for parents to use and must be able to book an appointment in `less than three clicks`.
- `Super Admins` will have backend access to manage appointments for the Users and Admin.

### The Why:

- The school was using paper forms which becomes costly and is environmentally unfriendly.

## Ideas and Inspiration Mind Map
![image](/documentation/readme_folder/images/mindmap_1.png)
![image](/documentation/readme_folder/images/mindmap2.png)


## Colour Palette Ideas:
![image](/documentation/readme_folder/images/color_pallette_ideas.png)

## Content Strategy:

- Main functionality is to book an appointment with the child's teacher.
- The Teacher has thier own admin area to view appointments and accept the appointment.
- The booking form will be easy to get to via the top navigation header or from the CTA button on the homepage.


## Typography:
https://fonts.google.com/
Montserrat was used due to it's warm style and being easy to read. The are qualities found in most school websites.

# Scope Plane:

## Functional Requirements:

1. Problem: The `User` needs to have direct access to the appointment form to make an appointment.

- Solution: Acces the form in `less than three clicks`.

2. Problem: `Users` must not be allowed to see other `User` appointments order to protect their sensitive data.

- Solution: Create an `Admin Area` so only Teachers can login and gain access.

3. Problem: `Users` need to be notified that thier appointment is confirmed.

- Solution: The `Admin` can accpect the appointment which then `sends a confirmtion email` to the `User`

4. Problem: If appointment is no longer needed then it need to be removed from the appointments list.

- Solution: The `Admin` can `delete appointment records` from the Admin Area.

5. Problem: The `Admin` accidentally click delete on the appointment.

- Solution: `Defensive Programming` put in place to ask the `Admin` to confirm deletion of the appointment. 

6. Problem: Harmful bots and malicious attackers could use the appintment form to crash the site.

- Solution: Implement a `CAPTCHA` to the form so human intervention is needed to submit the form.
  - CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) is a type of security measure known as challenge-response authentication. CAPTCHA helps protect the site from spam and automated scipts by asking the `User` to complete a simple test that proves you are human and not a computer trying to break into a password protected account.

  - A CAPTCHA test is made up of two simple parts: a randomly generated sequence of letters and/or numbers that appear as a distorted image, and a text box. To pass a the test and prove your human identity, simply type the characters you see in the image into the text box.

[Back to contents](#contents)

## Content Requirements:

- `Public` Homepage with hero text to explain what the app is for.
- `Public` Booking form for the `User` to create the appointment.
- `Public with Restrictions` Admin area to Teacher `Admin` to manage the appointments.
- `Public` Login Page
- `Private` Teacher `Admin` Register Page - Not public facing page. This will be a private link shared to Teachers.

[Back to contents](#contents)

## Interaction Design:

- All CTA (Call to Action) buttons will change colour to let the customers know that the buttons are clickable. 
- The `User` and `Admin` are notified for all changes to appointments and data.
- The `Admin` login state is reflected to the `Admin` on the front-end.
- The `User` recieves an email confirmation when the appointment have been accepted by the `User`.
- Both thr `Admin` and `User` and presents with alert messages when they trigger a certain action. i.e create an appointment, etc.

## Deployment

- The app was deployed to [Heroku](https://heroku.com).
- The app can be reached by the [link]()

### Local deployment to Staging

### Deployment to Git


---

1. Install the dependencies:

    - Open the terminal window and type:
    - `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`


1. Create a `.gitignore` file in the root directory of the project where you should add env.py and __pycache__ files to prevent the privacy of your secret data.

1. Create a `.env` file. This will contain the following environment variables:

    ```python
    import os
      os.environ['SECRET_KEY'] = 'Add a secret key'
      os.environ['DATABASE_URL'] = 'will be used to connect to the database'
      os.environ['DEBUG'] = 'True'
    ```

    *During the development stage DEBUG is set to True, but it is vital to change it to False.*

1. Run the following commands in a terminal to make migrations: 
    - `python3 manage.py makemigrations`
    - `python3 manage.py migrate`
1. Create a superuser to get access to the admin environment.
    - `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
    - Enter the required information (your username, email and password).
1. Run the app with the following command in the terminal:
    - `python3 manage.py runserver`
1. Open the link provided in a browser to see the app.

1. If you need to access the admin page:
    - Add /admin/ to the link provided.
    - Enter your username and password (for the superuser that you have created before).
    - You will be redirected to the admin page.


### Heroku Deployment

* Set up a local workspace on your computer for Heroku:
    - Create a list of requirements that the project needs to run:
      - type this in the terminal: `pip3 freeze > requirements.txt`
    - Commit and push the changes to GitHub
    
* Go to [www.heroku.com](www.heroku.com) 
* Log in or create a Heroku account.
* Create a new app with any unique name <name app>.

  ![Heroku. Create New App](documentation/deployment/new_heroku_app.png)

* Create a Procfile in your local workplace:

  ![Heroku. Procfile](documentation/deployment/heroku_procfile.png)
    
    This file will will contain the following:
    ```python
        web: gunicorn <name app>.wsgi:application
    ```
    - Commit and push the changes to GitHub.

* Go to resources in Heroku and search for postgresql. Select Hobby dev - Free and click on the provision button to add it to the project.

  ![Heroku. Postgres](documentation/deployment/heroku_postgres.png)

* Go to the settings app in Heroku and go to Config Vars.

  ![Heroku. Settings](documentation/deployment/settings_tab.png)

Click on Reveal Config Vars and add the following config variables:

| Key      | Value          |
|-------------|-------------|
| DATABASE_URL | ... | 
| DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC | 1 |
| EMAIL_HOST_PASS | ... |
| EMAIL_HOST_USER | ... |
| HEROKU_HOSTNAME | ... |
| SECRET_KEY | ... |


* Copy the value of DATABASE_URL and input it into the .env file and generate a secret key (you may use [Djecrety](https://djecrety.ir/) for secret key generation).
* Create EMAIL_HOST_PASS and EMAIL_HOST_USER with a gmail account and add values to these keys.
* Migrate changes.
* Set debug to False in settings.py
* Commit and push the changes to GitHub.
* Connect your repository to Heroku.

  ![Heroku. Connect to Heroku](documentation/deployment/heroku_connect_github.png)

* Deploy the app to Heroku by clicking "Deploy Branch" button. If you want to enable auto-deployment, click "Enable Automatic Deployment".

  ![Heroku. Deploy to Heroku](documentation/deployment/heroku_deploy_branch.png) 


The deployment process will start.

  ![Heroku. Deploy to Heroku](documentation/deployment/heroku_deploying.png) 

Click "View build logs" to see the progress of the deployment.

  ![Heroku. Deploy to Heroku](documentation/deployment/heroku_deploying_view.png)


*Due to security updates, Heroku dashboard will not allow you to deploy your app from GitHub. Thus, you need to run the following commands in your terminal:*

| action | terminal command | comment |
| ------ | ---------------- | ------- |
| login to your heroku account | `heroku login -i` | |
| create a new app on heroku | `heroku create NAME-OF-YOUR-APP` | if you haven't created the app before, and then, you can access the app via the Heroku dashboard and set up your config vars.|
| add remote to your local repository | `heroku git:remote -a NAME-OF-YOUR-APP` | if you have already created app on Heroku (before the security updates) and connected it using Heroku dashboard |
| deploy new version of the app | `git push heroku main` | |
| rename app | `git remote rename NAME-OF-YOUR-APP NAME-OF-YOUR-APP-2` | |

**Final Deployment**

* Set debug to False locally + delete DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC from config vars in Heroku dashboard.
* Commit and push the changes to GitHub.
